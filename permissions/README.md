Permissions
File permissions in Unix-like systems control who can access, modify, or execute files and directories.
There are three sets of permissions: owner, group, and other (or world).
Permissions are represented using a combination of three characters: r for read, w for write, and x for execute.
The chmod command is used to change permissions.
The chown command is used to change ownership of files and directories.
The chgrp command is used to change group ownership.
Permissions are usually represented in symbolic (e.g., rw-r--r--) or octal (e.g., 644) notation.
